# Changelog

## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-02

Field-validation tuning release based on a controlled Apple M4 Pro / 24 GiB sweep with the 17.97 GiB Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B IQ2_XXS model.

- Recorded repeatable 2K / 4K / 8K Metal sweep results.
- 2048: 258.8 prompt tok/s, 38.0 generation tok/s, +0.00 GiB swap.
- 4096: 247.2 prompt tok/s, 36.4 generation tok/s, +0.00 GiB swap.
- 8192: 236.7 prompt tok/s, 36.9 generation tok/s, +0.00 GiB swap.
- Changed the automatic default from 2K to 4K only for the field-validated Apple M4 Pro / 24 GiB / ~18 GiB resident profile.
- Kept 8K experimental because estimated policy headroom is only 0.28 GiB despite successful zero-swap completion.
- Kept planner status `CRITICAL`; observed success does not redefine the conservative headroom thresholds.
- Added robust macOS swap telemetry parsing and coverage for multiple `vm.swapusage` formats.
- Added a versioned benchmark record under `benchmarks/` and expanded the M4 Pro validation profile/docs.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-02

Field-hardening release after the first successful M4 Pro 24 GiB / Qwen3-Next 80B
resident Metal run.

- Added resident statuses: SAFE, TIGHT, CRITICAL, UNSAFE.
- Changed ~18 GiB / 24 GiB default context from 4096 to 2048.
- Added `redlite pressure` for macOS free-memory percentage and swap telemetry.
- Added `redlite sweep` for 2K/4K/8K context-depth benchmarking with JSON output.
- Added `--single-turn` to make scripted `llama-cli` runs exit after one answer.
- Increased default `redlite run` generation limit from 256 to 512 tokens.
- Added CRITICAL-margin warnings for run/server.
- Graceful Ctrl+C handling; interrupted Hugging Face downloads now explain resume.
- Updated Hugging Face install guidance for the modern `hf` CLI package.
- Fixed Bartowski IQ2 filenames inherited from 0.1.1.
- Improved `install.sh` PATH diagnostics for user Python installations on macOS.
- Added real M4 Pro field-observation profile and native Metal streaming roadmap.
